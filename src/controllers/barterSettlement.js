// Barter API
/*
This is a Unique Feature (Not for humans...) for bill spliting app. Settling Bill via Barter! What are we in pre Money ERA !

How this Works?
1. Admin when creating group sets/cap a amount (max barter equivalent for money)
2. User's while joining app set their risk appetite(max barter equivalent for money)
3. While settling debts they have 2 options :   
                1. Settle via payments
                2. Settle via Barter
4.The debtor(user) asks the creditor(user) for a barter , once the creditor approves the barter, both parties aggrees mutually
5.The payments(Barter in this case ) happens and both the creditor and debtor are free from further payments issue 


Note: This is completely an Experiment Feature
