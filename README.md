## About SplitBhai

splitBhai is a smart group expense management platform designed to make shared expenses, event planning, and settling debts within groups easy and fun. Whether it's for a trip, a dinner with friends, or managing household finances, splitBhai helps keep track of what everyone owes, gives financial insights, and even provides creative ways to settle debts without using money.

## Key Features

### Effortless Group Expense Management

splitBhai simplifies managing shared expenses by allowing users to create or join groups, add expenses, and split them among members. You can even organize expenses based on events like trips or social gatherings.

### Smart Financial Insights

Gain insight into spending patterns and group finances. splitBhai gives you visual analytics to help track who owes what and how much you've spent across different categories.

### Gamified Debt Settlement

Debt settling doesn’t have to be boring! splitBhai turns it into a game where members can earn rewards for settling dues on time.

### Non-Monetary Bartering

Not all debts need to be settled with cash! splitBhai allows users to trade services or goods to clear debts within the group.

### Event Planning Made Easy

Planning a trip or a special event? Tag expenses to specific events and keep track of everything in one place.

### Notifications & Alerts

Stay updated with reminders and alerts for upcoming payments, event activities, and group-related tasks.

## How splitBhai Works

1.  **Create or Join Groups**: Create a new group and invite others, or join an existing one using a link or code.
2.  **Add Expenses**: Track shared expenses and split them fairly among the group members.
3.  **Settle Debts**: Either pay directly or use non-monetary options to clear up what you owe.
4.  **Plan Events**: Group and tag expenses for specific events, making it easier to manage big plans like vacations or parties.
